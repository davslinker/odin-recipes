        <h1>Sausages on toast</h1>
        <img src="../images/sausage-on-toast.jpg"><br>
        <p>Just like it says on the tin, this is a simple recipe, but delicious.</p>
        <p>When you have a young child in the house, things can get frantic.<br>
        Sometimes little things like having a nice breakfast at your own pace, well
        you don't get that luxury.<br> This is one of my favourite dishes to make for when i 
        just don't have time to make something lavish but still want a shot of flavour in the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>You should be able to make it with most of the things you have in your house already!
    </p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
              <li>Sausages</li>
              <li>bread (the thicker the better)</li>
              <li>butter</li>
              <li>mustard</li>
              <li>your hot sauce of choice <em>(I like something with chipotle!)</em></li>
                </ul>
    <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>  
                <ol>
                    <li>Spread a <strong>generous</strong> amount of butter on a piece of 
                        toast.</li>
                    <li>Cut your sausages into little slices and put on a plate.</li>
                    <li>Microwave the sausages on high for a minute or so, enough to get
                        them spectacularly hot.
                    </li>
                    <li>Straight from the microwave, put the sausages on the buttery bread. Marvel
                        as the heat melts the butter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Top with hit sauce and mustard. Plate optional, depending
                        on level of degen you are.
                    </li>
                </ol>
    <p>And that's it! You're now enjoying a wonderful dish worthy of a community colege student.</p>
