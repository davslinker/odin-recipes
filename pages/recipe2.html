        <p>
            This canadian classis, loved through the ages, is criminally mislabeled on the box.<br>
            Here, I will show you the <strong>best</strong> way to make this dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>'If music be the food of love, play on'</em> - Twelfth night<br>
            If this quote can be taken to mean that food is music, then KD has to be the trumpet<br>
            blast from a Reel big fish song. Not everyone loves it. I do.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Box of Kraft Dinner</li>
                <li>Butter <em>(or failing that, margarine)</em></li>
                <li>Milk <em>(whole milk works best!)</em></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. The exact amount is unimportant,<br>
                but you need enough to comfortable submerge the mac.</li>
                <li>Once the water is brought to a boil, add the dry macaroni noodles. Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>Remove the noodles from the water and drain after <strong>5 minutes only.</strong><br>
                    The box may say seven, but it is <em>lying to you.</em> Drain <em>most</em> of the water,<br>
                    but not all.</li>
                <li>Mix cheese powder from box, milk, and butter together with noodles until all is <br>
                    an ungodly orange mess of bullshit. Add additional flavor enhancers, such as salt, pepper,<br>
                    additional cheeses, etc. But <strong>NEVER ADD KETCHUP.</strong></li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            That's it! You've made a wonderful dish! Good job!
