        <h1>Josh's salty white sauce</h1>

        <p>
            White sauce is considered to be one of the "mother sauces" in french cooking. <br>
            They might call it something fancy like bechamel but iunno. You can use it as a gravy, <br>
            as a stew base, in a lasagna, wherever! It's extremely versatile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The important thing to remember is that while the amount of milk <em>may change,</em> <br>
            The flour and rice always remain at a 1:1 ratio! Here we go.
        </p>
        <p>Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Milk <em>(whole milk works best!)</em></li>
                <li>Butter<em>(margarine or other oils may do in a pinch, but are not reliable</em></li>
                <li>White flour</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a frying pan on medium heat, melt one tablespoon of butter.</li>
                    <li>Add one teaspoon of white flour and thoroughly mix with butter until a sort of paste is created. This is called a <em>roux.</em></li>
                    <li>Allow the <em>roux</em> to cook in the pan for perhaps two minutes. It should bubble and spread, and slightly darken in color.<br>
                    Don't alow it to get too dark, too fast! If your roux burns, start over from the beginning. <br>
                    <em>Note: You are likely to burn your roux a few times until you learn to do it well consistently. <br>
                    If you're never burned a roux, you've never <strong>made</strong> a roux.</em></li>
                    <li>Pour in 2 cups of milk and mix thoroughly with roux. Allow the mixture to cook and thicken.</li>
                    <li>Continue gradually adding milk and cooking. The mixture will keep thickening after it's brought <br>
                    to boiling again. Once you have reached the desired thickness, season the sauce with salt and pepper.<br>
                    Other spices can be used as you please</li>
                </ol>
                <p>And that's it! I hope you enjoy my delicious white sauce. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) </p>
